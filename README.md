## üè∞ Architecture

* This app follows Clean Architecture Principles paired with MVVM architecture.
* The project is divided into three modules *app*, *data* and *domain*.
* The *app* module contains all the mobile-app specific code including views, viewmodels, fragments, activities and adapters. 
* The *data* module contains all the code that handles data. This includes handling the Retrofit calls and reading/writing to RoomDB.
* The *domain* module contains the basic blueprint and business logic of the application. It is a Java/Kotlin Library with no Android-specific code and holds the Model(Data Classes), Interfaces and Use Cases.
